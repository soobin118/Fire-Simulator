# Fire-Simulator
*This project is implemented using Unity*

I implemented educational fire simulator with Unity.  
Its situation is that the fire fighter extinguishes the fire in a burning office.  
It uses HTC VIVE. User becomes a fire fighter and can use the VIVE controller to extinguish fire by moving the hose. When user press the trigger on the controller, water flushes from the hose and vibration is felt.  
In addition, I implemented the teleport function because the office is very large, and blurred vision to convey the fire situation vividly.  

This project is implemented through virtual reality lecture. After the lecture is finished, it is selected as an excellent project, thus it finished SW registration.
